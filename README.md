# PFIA - Pipeline for Image Analysis
ImageJ Macro scripts associated to the PFIA Project in Sanchez-Arias, Carrier et al., 2021.
These ImageJ macro scrips serve as a reference to implement semi-automated image analysis pipelines for the analysis of cell densities in mouse brain coronal hemisections using FIJI/ImageJ
